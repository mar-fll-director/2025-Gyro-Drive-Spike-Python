# 2025-Gyro-Drive-Spike-Python
This repo will contain the new Spike Prime Python of the FLL Tools for Spike Prime 3.0 Robots used in FIRST LEGO League Challenge. This version incorporates all the goodies from the blocks version plus severl features unavailable in Blocks. This is a project to provide updated pre-packaged, tested and working on Spike Prime Python for FLL Challenge teams. 

We encourage you to immediately start learning Spike Python by access this on-line version for the [Spike Python Knowledge Base](https://spike.legoeducation.com/prime/help/lls-help-python#lls-help-python). This is the same information you would see in the hub, without the need for the Hub itself. Become Pythonic over the summer. 

## Presentations:<br/>
   [2025 Gyro Drive - Getting Ready and Testing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1amNZU9LRctaRJAooBi0PKXYJnOBhwPlg/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101907280092550552910&rtpof=true&sd=true) This presentation is designed as a teaser to show the 2025 Gyro Drive in action. 
   
   [2025 Gyro Drive - Introduction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/188H9rtgRhQCyudcpyrNF0xblFkjz2TN0/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101907280092550552910&rtpof=true&sd=true) Adapted to Spike Prime using MicroPython in 2025, this solution does not use native Spike HUB distance calculations, acceleration, or angle navigation. Instead, it reads the sensors, does the math and applies power to the motors. The math is elementary (line number and averages) enough for our FLL Challenge target audience.  

   [2025 Gyro Drive - Installation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1StXtoenVKDPdTLVKF6ZPAseEpUJxdh-d/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101907280092550552910&rtpof=true&sd=true) This presentation assumes you are familiar with this code. Before setting up your robot, you should read through all the  2025 Gyro Drive presentations so you are familiar with the terms and code layout. 

   [2025 Gyro Drive - The Code Overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N44QiTRXHaxvKKckrZj5UqavOmP87Bcg/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101907280092550552910&rtpof=true&sd=true) Gyro Drive contains a set of functions and classes, used in concert with Spike MicroPython, to support accurate navigation on the Spike Hub. Allow any FLL team to navigate, with great accuracy, any seasonâ€™s Challenge field while waving to their moms.

   [2025 Gyro Drive - Spinny Class](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17xijn_pu9CCdgxX3U1fAiIENyofOKOVt/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101907280092550552910&rtpof=true&sd=true) The Spinny class is an instance that allows you to run a motor to support an arm, lifter, or other spinny attachment. We used a class because it can be instantiated any number of times to support different spinny purposes. 


## Videos:<br/>
   [2025 Gyro Drive Spike Python - Getting Ready and Testing](https://youtu.be/Nl_ngaE-1OA) This is a taste of the 2025 Gyro Drive Spike Python Tool Kit. Please do the homework so you can be ready. This will show you working code examples we use the validate the robot settings.
   
   [2025 Gyro Drive Spike Python - Walking The Code](https://youtu.be/R-VimpPF5ug) This video will demonstrate a few programs. We will walk the code with you so you can see the robot moving and the code making moves.
   
   2025 Gyro Drive Spike Python - Install and Setup Guide TBD

## Versions:<br/>
   spp 25-06-13.llsb - This is a beta release. This code has been fully tested and works as expected. This is a Spike Python code file not a text file.
