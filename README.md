[Gyro Drive My Blocks 2024 - Primer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vga1y9exY-jyWSlCoF_mPb3-asiujL25wlZJDBCBb4c/edit?usp=sharing) will get you started. The playback video of this presentation as available on Youtube.com under [Gyro Drive My Blocks 2024 Presentation Video Playback](https://youtu.be/zddOJ2IT6iA)

I have created a presentation to [Move The Plate](https://midatlanticrobotics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Gyro-Drive-My-Blocks-Moving-The-Plate.pdf). I decide not to push new code as that would affect your existing projects. This tells you how to modify the existing plate code, create it from scratch and how to copy code between project files. Hope it helps. 

I and still working on a longer set of presentations and videos to help Coaches and students understand the code and the math. It is all about the math.
